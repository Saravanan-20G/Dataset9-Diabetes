## Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for analyzing the "Diabetes Prediction" dataset using Python and statistical methods. The dataset consists of various variables related to predicting diabetes, including gender, age, hypertension, heart disease, smoking history, BMI, HbA1c level, blood glucose level, and diabetes status. Our goal is to explore, analyze, and draw insights from this data.
